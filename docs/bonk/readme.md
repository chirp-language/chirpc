# Bonk 

Bonk is the very very simple data language thing that I  made. It has  two  main features which are storing values and list of values.

## Values

Values are declared with a datatype and they name, then value. There are 3 data types. Example below.
```
str name me
int age 17
bool alive true
```

# Lists 

Lists can contain other values and other  lists.

```
list a
int foo 123
    list b
        bool foo2 true
    end
end
```
